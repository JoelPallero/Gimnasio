# Gimnasio

It is a program to manage a gym and optimize the movements of clients, have information on the plans that the gym provides at hand, among other options.
Register clients, employees, payments, plans for clients, etc. It also has control of customer assistance. It's super simple and super simple to understand.
Not a difficult or stunning design. Any user who reviews it for a few minutes will know how to perfectly understand how to do each movement within the program.

It is built almost entirely with C# in VS for both the front and the back, and SQL was used for the database.
